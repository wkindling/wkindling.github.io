## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Computer Graphics Ph.D. degree at the University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Jernej Barbiƒç](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~jbarbic/). Before joining USC, I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [the mixed class](http://www.cis.umassd.edu/~hxu/alink/jclass/mixedclass.html) at Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. I was very fortunate to work with [Prof. Jin Huang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/hj/index.xml) and [Prof. Nobuyuki Umetani](https://cgenglab.github.io/en/authors/admin/) during my undergraduate studies. I also had four successive internships at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com), collaborating with [Dr. Danny M. Kaufman](https://dannykaufman.io).

## Research Interests

I am generally interested in both physically based simulation and geometry processing, especially in adaptive simulation, incremental potential contact(IPC), finite element method(FEM), numerical optimization, surface editing, and co-dimensional elastic object simulation involved with differential geometry. I always come across problems that are difficult to solve and publish:)
