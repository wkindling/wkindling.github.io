## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Computer Graphics Ph.D. degree at the University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Jernej Barbiƒç](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~jbarbic/). Before joining USC, I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [the mixed class](http://www.cis.umassd.edu/~hxu/alink/jclass/mixedclass.html) in Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. I was very fortunate to work with [Prof. Jin Huang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/hj/index.xml) and [Prof. Nobuyuki Umetani](https://cgenglab.github.io/en/authors/admin/) during my undergraduate studies. I also had two successive internships at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com).


## Research Interests

My research interests generally include physically based simulation and geometry processing.  
I am recently focusing on codimensional elastic object simulation involved with differential geometry.
